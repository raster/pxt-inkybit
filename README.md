 A 250x122 pixel, tri-colour e-ink display for low frequency, high visibility status display.

This extension adds support for the Pimoroni inky:bit to makecode.microbit.org.

A inky:bit is required to use this extension, grab yours here: https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-bit

To use this extension, go to https://makecode.microbit.org/, click "Advanced" then "Add Package" and search for inky:bit.

## JavaScript Reference

inky:bit has a 250x122 pixel display, each pixel can be set to white, black or red.

### Text Size

There are four text sizes available, all using the built-in 5x5px micro:bit font:

1. `TextSize.Regular` - 2x - each font pixel is 2x2 real pixels
2. `TextSize.Tiny` - 1x - each font pixel is a single pixel
3. `TextSize.Medium` - 3x - each font pixel is 3x3 real pixels
4. `TextSize.Large` - 4x - each font pixel is 4x4 real pixels

### Get the size of your inky:bit

The blocks `width` and `height` return the width and height of inky:bit in pixels respectively.

Use these in your loops and flow control to draw amazing things!

### Set a single pixel

Set a single pixel on inky:bit. Note, you must call `show` to display your changes.

* `x` is the x position, from 0-295
* `y` is the y position, from 0-127
* `color` is the color, one of `inkybit.Color.White`,  `inkybit.Color.Black`,  `inkybit.Color.Accent`

```
inkybit.setPixel(x: number, y: number, color: number)
```

For example:

```
inkybit.setPixel(5, 5, inkybit.Color.Black)
```

### Display your changes

When you've finished setting pixels and drawing text, you must call `show` to display your changes.

```
inkybit.show()
```

### Clear the display

To clear the display, you can call `clear`, you must also call `show` if you want to display your changes.

```
inkybit.clear()
inkybit.show()
```

### Display an image

To show an image on inky:bit, use `drawImage`:

* `image` is the micro:bit image you want to display
* `x` is the x position, from 0-295
* `y` is the y position, from 0-127
* `color` is the color, one of `inkybit.Color.White`,  `inkybit.Color.Black`,  `inkybit.Color.Accent`
* `size` is the text size, one of `inkybit.TextSize.Tiny`, `inkybit.TextSize.Regular`, `inkybit.TextSize.Medium`, `inkybit.TextSize.Large`

```
inkybit.drawImage(image: Image, x: number, y: number, color: Color, size: TextSize)
```

### Display a text string

To show a string of text on inky:bit you should use `drawText`:

* `text` is the text you want to show
* `x` is the x position, from 0-295
* `y` is the y position, from 0-127
* `color` is the color, one of `inkybit.Color.White`,  `inkybit.Color.Black`,  `inkybit.Color.Accent`
* `size` is the text size, one of `inkybit.TextSize.Tiny`, `inkybit.TextSize.Regular`, `inkybit.TextSize.Medium`, `inkybit.TextSize.Large`

```
inkybit.drawText(text: string, x: number, y: number, color: Color, size: TextSize)
```

For example:

```
inkybit.drawText(0, 1, "Hello World")
```

### Measure a text string

It can be useful to know how long a string of text might be, in pixels, on inky:bit. Use `measureText` to find out:

```
inkybit.measureText(text: string, size: TextSize)
```

For example:

```
let width: number = inkybit.measureText("Hello World")
```

This will return a number of pixels corresponding to the length of the text as it's displayed on inky:bit (using the built-in 5x5 micro:bit font at the size you specify).

### Icons & Arrows

You can use icons and arrows in your text, just place their name in curly brackets like so: `"Hello {Heart} World"` or: `"Boo! Went the {Ghost}"` or: `"{Heart}{SmallHeart}{Heart} Happy Birthday! {Heart}{SmallHeart}{Heart}"`

Here's a list of icons you can use:

* Heart
* SmallHeart
* Yes
* No
* Happy
* Sad
* Confused
* Angry
* Asleep
* Surprised
* Silly
* Fabulous
